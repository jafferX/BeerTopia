# BeerTopia
A Xamarin mobile application that uses teh brewerydb api to query and find different breweries and beers. The applications employs
an mvvm design pattern. The pllication was amde as the final project of my mobile development class with my group. 
I primarily worked on the back-end of the application by creating an api manager that handles all the api calls.
